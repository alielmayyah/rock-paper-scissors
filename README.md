Project Description: Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for styling. The game provides an interactive user interface where players can select their move—rock, paper, or scissors—by clicking on the respective button. The computer randomly generates its move each time, and the game determines the winner based on the traditional rules:

    Rock crushes scissors
    Scissors cut paper
    Paper covers rock

Features:

    Interactive Buttons:
        Users can choose between rock, paper, and scissors by clicking the corresponding buttons with emoji images.
    Dynamic Results Display:
        The game displays the result of each round (win, lose, tie) dynamically on the screen.
    Counters for Wins, Losses, and Ties:
        The game tracks the number of wins, losses, and ties and displays these counters to the user.
    Reset Button:
        A reset button allows the user to reset the counters for wins, losses, and ties back to zero.

Implementation Details:

    HTML: Provides the structure of the web page, including buttons for selecting rock, paper, or scissors, and elements for displaying results and counters.
    CSS: Used for basic styling, with Bootstrap integrated for responsive design and additional styling.
    JavaScript: Handles the game logic, including random move generation for the computer, determining the result of each round, updating the counters, and resetting the counters.

User Interaction:

    The user clicks on one of the three buttons (rock, paper, or scissors).
    The computer randomly selects its move.
    The result of the round is displayed, and the appropriate counter (win, loss, or tie) is updated.
    The user can reset the counters at any time by clicking the reset button.

This simple yet engaging project demonstrates the use of fundamental web development technologies to create an interactive and enjoyable user experience.
